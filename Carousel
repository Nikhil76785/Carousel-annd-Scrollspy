        <h1>Table Tennis</h1>
        <p><code>Table Tennis</code> (also known as ping-pong) is a racket sport derived from <code>tennis</code> but distinguished by its playing surface
        being atop a stationary table, rather than the court on which players stand. Either individually or in teams of two,
        players take alternating turns returning a light, hollow ball over the table's net onto the opposing half of the court
        using small rackets until they fail to do so, which results in a point for the opponent. <code>Play is fast, requiring quick
        reaction and constant attention</code>, and is characterized by an emphasis on spin, which can affect the ball's trajectory
        more than in other ball sports.</p>

        <p>The name <mark>"ping-pong"</mark> was in wide use before British manufacturer <mark>J. Jaques & Son Ltd</mark> trademarked it in 1901. The name
        "ping-pong" then came to describe the game played using the rather expensive Jaques's equipment, with other
        manufacturers calling it table tennis. A similar situation arose in the <mark>United States</mark>, where Jaques sold the rights to
        the "ping-pong" name to Parker Brothers. <mark>Parker Brothers</mark> then enforced its trademark for the term in the 1920s, making
        the various associations change their names to "<mark>table tennis</mark>" instead of the more common, but trademarked, term. The
        U.S. trademark for "Ping-Pong" is currently owned by Indian Industries, Inc.<mark> Escalade Sports</mark>.</p>
